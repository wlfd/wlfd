## Hello 👋

---

I am **Wilfred Lai**, a Technical Product Manager serving over 7.2 million HSBC customers to launch mobile investment across Canada, US, and Mexico, and enable secure and efficient data migration for the $13.5 billion RBC acquisition of HSBC Canada; and successfully grown an e-commerce store by 29% into 6-figure sales!

Outside work, I'm pacing for the Vancouver Sun Run and BMO half marathon, and completing my PMI-ACP certification. My diverse background includes experience in full stack web development, e-commerce, digital marketing, retail management, and corporate and personal tax accounting; I was also a licensed Canadian Investment Funds and Life, Accident, and Sickness Insurance agent.

Exploring new development tools and getting into the groove of coding again.
